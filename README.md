# RecallRush Memory Test

RecallRush is a web-based memory testing application that challenges and improves users' memory skills. The application presents users with a grid-based interface, where certain grids blink and users must click on the correct grids.

## Key Features

- **Grid Interface**: The application displays a grid of cells on the user's screen. Each cell represents a clickable unit.

- **Blinking Grids**: At the start of each round, specific grids randomly blink. These blinking grids indicate the correct cells that users need to identify.

- **User Interaction**: Users can click on the grids they believe are blinking to select them. Correctly selected grids turn green, while incorrect selections turn red.

- **Scoring and Progression**: RecallRush keeps track of users' scores, including the number of correct and incorrect selections. As users successfully click on all the correct grids, the game progresses to the next round with more grids and higher difficulty.

- **Dynamic Grid Generation**: Each round generates a new set of grids with different blinking patterns, providing a fresh challenge for users.

- **Timer**: The application displays a timer to measure the time taken by users to complete each round, adding an element of speed and urgency to the game.

## Technologies Used

- Front-end: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and AJAX for smooth automation.
- Back-end: Server-side language PHP.
- Database: MySQL for storing user data and high scores.
